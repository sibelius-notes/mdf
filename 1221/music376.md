# Harmony
Study notes for post-tonal harmony. From several textbooks.

Materials and Techniques of Post-Tonal Music

### Chords and Simultaneities
Ambiguity may be introduced for inversion of tall chords (e.g., ninth).

Added 2nd or 4th can be considered as added 9th or 11th.
Added notes: "wrong-note style".

"split" chord members: add a minor 2nd. 7th chord with split 3rds is common. Others also occur.

open-5th chords: omitting third. Typically they are used to create an impression of the Orient or of
the distant past.

Quartal (built on 4th) and Quintal (built on 5th) chords. Quintal: more open and stable sound.
Diminished 4th and aug 5th, enharmonic with M3 and m6. Scriabin’s mystic chord.

Secundal chords: built from M2 or m2. these called cluster and tone cluster.

Mixed-interval chords: combine 2 or more interval types.

Whole tone chords: from whole-tone scale.

polychord: combines two ore more chords, but it's important the harmonic entities are being juxtaposed.

Stravinsky’s famous Petrushka chord combines two triads a tritone apart: C major
and F# major. another polychord:
F# major/G major.

### Harmonic progression and tonality
cadence: V-I, IV-I, vii<sup>o</sup>6-I, iv6-V

root movements by 5ths tend to be avoided.

[Debussy's unpredictable progression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LmhvNdbN7A).
doubly chromatic
mediant relationships: A major–F minor and Gb major–D minor.


pitch-centric: music that has a tonal center
established through nontraditional means.

pitch center by assertion: reiteration, return, pedal point, ostinato, accent, formal placement, register, and similar
techniques to draw a listener’s attention to a particular pitch class.
