# Lecture 2: Skeleton System and Muscular System
## Axial vs. Appendicular Skeleton
- The skeletal system is subdivided into axial (中轴骨) and appendicular (四肢骨) components
- The axial skeleton consists of the skull, rib cage, and vertebral (脊椎) column
- The appendicular skeleton consists of the pectoral girdle (胸带), upper limb bones, pelvic girdle (骨盆带), and lower limb bones

Classification of Bones by Shape
- Lone bones are tubular (管状的)
- Short bones are cube shaped
- Flat bones usually protect underlying organs
- Irregular bones have unique shapes
- Sesamoid (芝麻样) bones develop in tendons (肌腱) and are shaped like seeds
