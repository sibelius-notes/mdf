# What is the "Aesthetics of Music"?
## What is aesthetics?
From [OED](https://www.oed.com/)
1. Philosophy of the beautiful or of art
2. Systems of principles for the appreciation of the beautiful
3. The distinctive underlying principles of a work of art or a genre
4. The works of an artist, the arts of a culture, etc

Origins of the word: from Greek, "to perceive sensuously" (with the senses)/sensory perception

Term "Aesthetics" first explicitly used ~1750: OED 1770. Modern term, age of rationalism

## What is the Aesthetics of Music?
Many definitions:
- Lydia, Geohr, Grove article, "Philosophy of Music, III: Aesthetics, 1750-2000," 2001: = "theoretical reflections on the status of music as an art and as a form of meaningful articulation"
- 1750: paradigm shift:
    - music's autonomy from function, language, religion
    - status as a fine art
- Connection with Philosophy
    - but an area of inquiry with an establish history within the study of/discipline of music
    - broader context in which we examine the nature of, and seek meaning, in music

## Our approach
Can we take a general aesthetics of art and apply it to music?
- principles & questions that apply to all of the arts; artistic movements
- music's special attributes (technical language, performing art, occurs in time)
- music's changing identity: not always considered an art

Chronological approach
- aestheticians/theorists building on work of predecessors
- concerns/questions/obsessions of their time

Broad approach: tendencies in different periods (sociological, political, artistic, technological, scientific...)
