# The Era & its Music
**Music Since 1900**. What is this era?
Time frame: 20th Century; 21st Century?

Do we define the era based on dates or other factors?

Cohesion? Is there an overriding style or structure?

co-existing diversity:
- Many contrasting trends (“isms”)
- styles, forms, techniques, nature of music

**Relationship with past**
- had to compete for concert stage with classics of the past
- self-consciously “modern” (1889-1918)
- founded on past but need to break away:
- quest for originality:
    - every work an artistic statement
- challenge the past:
    - Functional tonality, goal-driven structures
    - Some radical breaks with the past
- not a steady “development”:
    - decisive moments/events

# 19th-Century Precedents
We trace precedents on 2 paths:
- Austro-German tradition
- non-Germanic, French/Russian traditions

## Prelude to Tristan und Isolde
RICHARD WAGNER (1813-1883), *Prelude to Tristan und Isolde* (1859/65 premiere)

Stretched the bounds of tonality through:
- Increased chromaticism:
    - distant keys & stepwise melodic motion
- Prolonged dissonance
- Less dependence on keys that support the central tonic

decisive historical “moment”
- “crisis in Romantic harmony” (E. Kurth)
- 1<sup>st</sup> chord in 5-hour opera:
    - 4 dissonant chords in a row
- g# b d# f: ambiguous function
    - Conflation of 2 chromatic Leitmotifs
    - recurring themes attached to characters, concepts, objects
- Tonic chord (A minor) & cadences avoided
- deepens tension & resolution of tonality: for drama
- Clear resolution at very end of opera

## The idle, noisy day is over

MODEST MUSORGSKY(1839-81): “The idle, noisy day is over”, Song No. 3 from Sunless (1874)

Strong key of C: anchor, but freely roams:
- Introduces “foreign” elements (B♭ & A♭)
- Juxtaposition of chords for colour only, not tonal function: G♭
    - e.g., G♭triad –> G7 chord (mm. 6-7, 14)–> C
- Chromatic melody: moves by step
- Whole-tone scale suggested (voice, mm35-36)
- Influenced Debussy: piano, m16ff: Debussy borrowed pattern in Nuages


## Nuages gris
FRANZ LISZT (1811-1886), Nuages gris (Grey Clouds, 1881)

key signature & tonic triad (m.2 G B♭D) suggests g minor,
but rejects traditional harmonic functions

Points to exhaustion of tonality, anticipates the crisis:
- Highly chromatic: semitone movement
- Augmented triad = central harmonic unit (= 2 major 3rds)
- Parallel movement vs conventional chord progressions
- Static bass line: oscillates B♭ - A
- Avoids cadence structure, even very end of piece
- Last chord = Augmented triad (E♭G B) + A
    - = 4 notes from whole-tone collection: A E♭G B <br> E♭[F] G A B [C#]

#  French Modernism I: Debussy
Claude Debussy (French, 1862-1918): Different direction: “pleasure in the moment”

Some Influences and Inspiration:
-  sought independence from Austro-German tradition: Wagner
-  French tradition
-  Russians: Musorgsky
-  medieval music
-  Asia: Javanese gamelan; Chinese & Japanese music
- Impressionist painters & Symbolist poets

Some keys to Debussy’s style:
- common-practice harmony avoided, weakened:
    - tonal focus remains: but without chordal functional relationships; quasi-independent chords
    - undermines need to resolve: no urgency or drive towards end goal
- creates, juxtaposes musical images:
    -  themes & motives: not developed
    -  dissonances: don’t need to resolve
    -  Sonorities/chords move in parallel motion
    -  instrumental timbres/colours intrinsic to musical content
    -  contrasts of scale types, exotic scales
        - some scales used by Debussy: whole-tone, pentatonic, octatonic
- Impressionism : music that evokes moods & visual imagery through colourful harmony & instrumental timbre
    - a) Monet: through colour & light: Monet, “Impression: Sunrise”, 1874
    - b) Debussy: through harmony & tone colour

## “Nuages” from Nocturnes
“Nuages” from Nocturnes (1897-99, premiered in 1900 & 1901):

title: “Nocturnes”, focus on colour

form: A B A’: typical 3-part form

large orchestra: for colour
- divided muted strings: “shimmer”
- dabs of colour: brief motives (2 or 3 notes)

interaction of tone colour with motive, scale type
-  oscillating pattern fifths, thirds
    - modelled on Musorgsky, Sunless piano acc’t
    - appearances feature different tone colours, pitches
-  octatonic English horn motive: c# d e f b (m.5)
    - motive never developed, transposed, always English horn
    - complete identification between timbre and motive
-  middle section (B) of “Nuages”:
    - 1889: Paris Universal Exposition: “Decisive moment”
        - Javanese gamelan: Indonesian orchestra – mostly gongs & percussion
- pentatonic tune & similar articulation (harp & flute)

# French Modernism II: Maurice Ravel
Maurice Ravel (1875–1937) : some characteristics
1. often grouped with Debussy as impressionist
2. outsider, independent streak
3. impressionist works: strong musical imagery, colorful harmonies
4. Interest in Classic forms, genres
5. French tradition: stylized dances, suite
6. Varied Influences:
    - a) French symbolism
    - b) Jazz elements, Blues
    - c) Viennese Waltz
    - d) Spanish idioms
    - e) French/Russian

Ravel, *Rapsodie espagnole* (NAWM 173)
- orchestral suite in 4 movements: I “Prélude à la nuit” & II “Malagueña”
- multiple influences: evocations of Spain, authentic flavour & Rimsky-Korsakov

NAWM 173a: I “Prélude à la nuit” (Night Prelude)
- Dynamics: mostly quiet
- Repeating figure (ostinato): F-E-D-C#
    - Opening: descending pattern: muted strings, duple meter
    - Evokes Spanish accompaniment pattern
    - Ambiguous: d minor scale or octatonic?
    - Creates nocturnal mood
- M14: clarinets: Seguidilla-like gestures
- M28: diatonic string melody, woodwind flourishes (e.g., 2 bassoons)
- Ends on A

NAWM 173b : II “Malagueña” = a Spanish dance or song in flamenco style
- Triple meter Phrygian mode
- Usually in 2 parts
- Opening:
    - plucking low string ~ guitar
    - Repeating descending 4-note pattern ~ flamenco guitar pattern
    - Muted trumpet: new f#-minor melody based on 4-note pattern
- Second part (m.73): Song in Flamenco style: English horn
- Closing (79): Return of 4-note pattern from I: F-E-D-C#
    - Played on celesta
