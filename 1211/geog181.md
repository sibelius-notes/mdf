# Week 7: Mapping Quantitative Data

## Describing Spatial Data
**Level of measurement**:
- **Nominal**: or categorical.
- **Ordinal**.
- **Interval**: the distance between values is meaningful. From [questionpro](https://www.questionpro.com/blog/interval-data/): "Interval data, also called an integer, is defined as a data type which is measured along a scale, in which each point is placed at equal distance from one another."
- **Ratio**: a quantified difference between values with an absolute zero point. An example from [small arms survey](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/gbav).


# Week 8: Choropleth Maps and Classification
Choropleth maps use a sequence of colour shades to represent categories of data for a given area of geography.

## Overview of Choropleth Mapping
A choropleth map represents data not as individual points.

In class, we examine [How long will YOU live?](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2240855/How-does-nation-rank-world-map-life-expectancy.html). Then [How does your nation rank?](https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-world-map-of-average-life-expectancy-by-country-how-5964093).

Three main colour schemes are:
- **Qualitative**.
- **Sequential**.
- **Diverging**.



## Selecting a Data Classification Method
The purpose of classification is to simplify data through creating groupings of similar data points.

**Classification Method**
- **unclassified data**.
- **equal interval method**.
- **quantile (equal count) classification method**.
- **natural breaks classification method**.
- **unique values classification**.



# Week 9: Mapping Terrain
## Topographic Maps and Symbols
**Topographic maps**: show a selection of features on the land surface.

## Representing Continuous Surfaces
Type of Contours
- **Index contours**
- **Intermediate contours**
- **Supplementary contours**
- **Depression contours**

## Landscape Visualization
The visualization of landscape through drawing techniques has become somewhat of a relic of traditional paper cartography.
- hachuring: [wiki](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%99%95%E6%BB%83%E6%B3%95)
- addition of lines, shading, and hachuring
- Hill shading
- 3-D Approaches to Visualizing Terrain
