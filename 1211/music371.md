# What is Music Theory?
Readings: Palisca, Claude V. & Ian D. Bent, “[Theory, theorists](https://musictheory.tistory.com/entry/Theory-theorists-in-music)” from *Grove Music Online.*

Some random excerpts from the article...

## Preface & Intro
- Theory is now understood as principally the study of the structure of music:  melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony and form.
- A body of theory exists also about other aspects of music, such as composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation and electronic sound production.
- disparate: Boethius,  Giovanni Maria Artusi, Francesco Gasparini,  Heinrich Schenker.

## Definitions
- Theory its Greek root theōria, from verb  theōreō: inspect, look at, behold, observe, contemplate, consider
- Etymologically, act of contemplation
- Aristides Quintilianus created a plan about CE 300: Theoretical (Natural, Artificial) & Practical (Creative, Executive)
- Modern version:
    - Theoretical
        - Scientific
        - Technical: parameters
        - Critical
    - Practical
        - Creative
        - Pedagogical
        - Executive
        - Functional

This entire field has sometimes been called *Musikwissenschaft*, the science of music, or musicology.

## 10. The Baroque period.

Rameau marked a return to naturalism and rationalism after the pragmatic theory of the thoroughbass. By arithmetic manipulation of the ratios representing the primary division of the string, he was able to generate the primary major triad.

## 11. The Classical–Romantic period.
Johann Philip Kirnberger (Die Kunst des reinen Satzes in der Musick, 1774–9) accepted many of Rameau’s ideas, such as inversion, but he gave more importance to melodic functions.


## 14. 20th century & 15. New theoretical paradigms, 1980-2000.
The most crucial force in 20th-century theory was not Wagner’s chromaticism, Debussy’s non-functional harmony or Schoenberg’s 12-note system, but the historical perspective that made it inconceivable to try to explain music, past, present and future, by a single universal theory. Many 20th-century theories are deliberately limited in their applicability.

The final part of this theory itself spawned a new line of enquiry known as ‘Neo-Riemannian theory’, which goes back to Lewin's first article on the topic (JMT, 1982).

This is based on the chapter 9 of Kostka.

## Characteristics of atonal music
First, not pitch-centric.

The pitch aspect of atonal music required a new vocabulary: cell, basic cell, set, pitch set, pitch-class set, and referential sonority. The analysis of atonal music usually
includes the process of identifying and labeling these important pitch sets, a process that
involves **segmentation**.

Segmentation is in some ways much more difficult than the analysis of chords in
traditional tonal music. Two problems
- when beginning the analysis, one usually
does not know which sets will or won't turn out to be significant in the piece.
-  labeling the sets for ease of comparison

As we shall see, Forte’s system of pitch-class sets reduces the number of combination of pitches sets considerably.

**Enharmonic equivalence** always applies when dealing with pitch
classes. Through **octave equivalence**, we identify C major triads.  In addition, we consider C major triads and F major triads to be **transpositionally equivalent**.
To analyze and compare the pitch-class sets in atonal music, we need a process that
will reduce any set to some basic form: **normal order**. The normal order of a pitch-class set is that ordering of the PCs that spans the
smallest possible interval.
- begin the scale on any of the PCs,
- leave out any duplicated PCs, but continue up to octave.
- find largest interval between any two adjacent PCs
- the *top* note of this largest interval is the *bottom* note of the normal order.

A complication that occasionally arises is seen in a set that has no single largest interval,
but instead has two or more intervals that are tied for largest. The tie is broken by comparing the intervals
between the first and next-to-last notes in both versions.  The normal order is the version with the *smaller* interval. If the intervals between the first and next-to-last notes
had been the same, we would have proceeded to the intervals between the first and
third-to-last notes, and so on, until the tie was broken.
In some sets, however, the
tie cannot be broken, and in such cases we choose the ordering that begins with
the smallest pitch-class integer.

The interval successions in the two versions are identical (because they are transpositionally equivalent), so it is impossible to break the tie. A set such as this is called a **transpositionally symmetrical set**, because it reproduces its own pitch-class content under one or more intervals of
transposition.

Pitch-class sets that are related by inversion to be equivalent. This is called
**inversional equivalence**.

**Best normal order**. This concept is important because the best normal order is the
generic representation of all possible transpositions and inversions of a set.
- first find its normal order and notate its inversion.
- normal order of the inversion
- compare the two normal orders:  the “better” of the two is considered to
be the best normal order.

A set, in which the normal order of the set and the normal
order of its inversion are identical or transpositionally equivalent, is called an **inversionally symmetrical set** because it reproduces its pitchclass content at one or more levels of inversion.

After applying numbers to the best normal order, the resulting series of
numbers is called the **prime form**, and it represents all of the pitch-class sets in that
set class.

Because inversional equivalence is still in effect, we then have six **interval classes** (“interval class” is sometimes
abbreviated as IC):

| Interval Class | Pitch-Class Interval | Traditional Interval |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :--: |
| 1 | 1, 2  | m2, M7 |
| 2 | 2, 10 | M2, m7 |
| 3 | 3, 9  | m3, M6 |
| 4 | 4, 8  | M3, m6 |
| 5 | 5, 7  | P4, P5 |
| 6 | 6     | A4, d5 |

To analyze a set according to its interval content, tabulate all of the ICs between
each note in the set and all of the notes *above* it.
Consider a set (example 9-17 in the textbook).

The table below demonstrates the procedure:

<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">From</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Up to</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">IC</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>

<td style="text-align: center;">Ab</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">G</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">B</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">4</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">G</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">C#</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">6</td>

</table>

It contains exactly one occurrence of each IC. This information is usually presented in the form of an **interval-class vector** (or ICV). So for this set, because
it contains one of each IC, has an ICV of <111111>.

Pairs of sets that share the same vector (they come only in pairs) are
known as **Z-related sets**.

This means that if we transpose a triad up or down by a
minor 3rd, a major 3rd, or a perfect 4th, exactly one pitch class will be held **invariant** — that is, it will be retained.

An **inversion matrix** will allow us to predict how many PCs will be held invariant
under inversion. For example, we convert (D, Eb, G, A) set to (2, 3, 7, 9), then

![](/mdf/pics/inversion-mat.png)

Invert the set, we get (3, 5, 9, 10). This is considered the 0th transposition. If you look in the matrix, you will find
two occurrences of the number 0, which means that two PCs will be held invariant — in this case PCs 3 and 9. There is one occurrence of the number 2, so transposing by PCI 2 will keep one PC
invariant: (5,7,11,0), and so on.

## Forte Labels
Allen Forte’s Structure
of Atonal Music.

Prime form of a set, then look up its Forte Label as well as its ICV.

Every time we see an "Z" in the label, for example, 4-Z29, it means its IVC is shared with another a pitchclass set.

## Subset
Sometimes pitch-class sets that do not belong to the same set class may be related to
each other by sharing common subsets, just as C7 and Cadd6 are closely related because
they have the C major triad in common.

**literal subset**: literally the same pitch class. **nonliteral subsets**, related by transposition or inversion, but
do not literally share the same three pitch classes.

A special kind of subset is the **scalar subset**, which is a subset that is derived from
a particular scale type.

## Aggregates
The term aggregate is used to refer to any such statement (all 12 pitch classes be
heard within a fairly short period) of all 12 pitch
classes, without regard to order or duplication.
