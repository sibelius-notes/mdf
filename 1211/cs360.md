This set of notes is basically  from the [Watrous text](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/ToC-notes/ToC-notes.pdf) with some addons and comments from the instructor or myself. This term, we are following [Version of June 17, 2017](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs360/cs360notes.pdf).

# Course overview and mathematical foundations
Important idea:
> Computational problems, devices, and processes can themselves be viewed as
mathematical objects.

If you want to avoid this sort of paradox (Russell's), you need to replace naïve set theory
with axiomatic set theory, which is quite a bit more formal and disallows objects
such as the set of all sets (which is what opens the door to let in Russell’s paradox). For more interesting discussion, check [PMATH 433](/pmath433).

The **size** of a finite set is the number of elements if contains. If <span>&#92;(A &#92;)</span> is a finite set, then we write <span>&#92;(&#124; A &#124; &#92;)</span> to denote this number. Sets can also be infinite. Note that in this course, we will include 0 as a natural number.

Defn 1.1
: A set <span>&#92;(A &#92;)</span> is countable if either (i) <span>&#92;(A &#92;)</span> is empty, or (ii) there exists an
onto (or surjective) function of the form <span>&#92;(f:\mathbb B \to A &#92;)</span>. If a set is not countable, then
we say that it is uncountable.

These three statements are equivalent for any choice of a set <span>&#92;(A &#92;)</span>:
1. <span>&#92;(A &#92;)</span> is countable.
2. There exists a one-to-one (or injective) function of the form <span>&#92;(g:A\to \mathbb B &#92;)</span>.
3. Either <span>&#92;(A &#92;)</span> is finite or there exists a one-to-one and onto (or bijective) function of
the form <span>&#92;(h:\mathbb N\to A &#92;)</span>.
