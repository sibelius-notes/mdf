# Elements of Opera
## What is Opera?
The literal translation of the term “opera” does not tell us much:
- Opera = Latin for “works” (plural of opus “work”)
- Short form for “opera in musica” (work in music)
- Different names through history:
    - Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo (1607) was labelled “favola in musica”
    (a fable in music)
    - French Baroque opera: Tragédie lyrique or Tragédie en
    musique (lyrical tragedy or tragedy in music)
    - Dramma per musica (drama for music): term used for
    Italian serious opera from 17th century to early 19th century
- Different forms of opera: e.g.
    - Comic opera
    - Serious opera
    - Singspiel: German opera with spoken dialogue

Opera: a play that is sung = drama with continuous music, staged with scenery,
costumes & action
- multi-media, collaborative, expensive genre:
    - Librettist, composer, singers (who must act), conductors,
    instrumentalists, costume designers, set designers…. and an
    audience!
- controversial: strong reactions for and against

- Look at the criticism against opera and the defense
- powerful: emotionally; socially; politically…
- relevant today?
    - Universal themes of life, death, love, hatred, pain…
    - a place in contemporary collective popular imagination

operas start with words before one note is
written:

**Libretto**: (“little book”): 
- The words or text of an opera
- dramatic text + scene instructions for an opera
- Normally written by someone else (librettist) to be
set to music by the composer
- The librettist will often indicate places to be set to:
    - recitative (prose, no poetic meter)
    - Aria (poetry, regular poetic meter)
- The composer takes the libretto and dramatizes
the story through music!

**Aria**: solo song
- A solo piece written for a main character
- focuses on expression of character’s
emotions/reactions to plot
- Time stands still
- Often inner thoughts and emotions of
character
- monologue in poetic stanza form
- Features repetition of text & music
    - usually in patterned form
