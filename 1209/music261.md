# Elements of Opera
## What is Opera?
The literal translation of the term “opera” does not tell us much:
- Opera = Latin for “works” (plural of opus “work”)
- Short form for “opera in musica” (work in music)
- Different names through history:
    - Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo (1607) was labelled “favola in musica”
    (a fable in music)
    - French Baroque opera: Tragédie lyrique or Tragédie en
    musique (lyrical tragedy or tragedy in music)
    - Dramma per musica (drama for music): term used for
    Italian serious opera from 17th century to early 19th century
- Different forms of opera: e.g.
    - Comic opera
    - Serious opera
    - Singspiel: German opera with spoken dialogue

Opera: a play that is sung = drama with continuous music, staged with scenery,
costumes & action
- multi-media, collaborative, expensive genre:
    - Librettist, composer, singers (who must act), conductors,
    instrumentalists, costume designers, set designers…. and an
    audience!
- controversial: strong reactions for and against

- Look at the criticism against opera and the defense
- powerful: emotionally; socially; politically…
- relevant today?
    - Universal themes of life, death, love, hatred, pain…
    - a place in contemporary collective popular imagination

operas start with words before one note is
written:

**Libretto**: (“little book”): 
- The words or text of an opera
- dramatic text + scene instructions for an opera
- Normally written by someone else (librettist) to be
set to music by the composer
- The librettist will often indicate places to be set to:
    - recitative (prose, no poetic meter)
    - Aria (poetry, regular poetic meter)
- The composer takes the libretto and dramatizes
the story through music!

## Aria
**Aria**: solo song
- A solo piece written for a main character
- focuses on expression of character’s
emotions/reactions to plot
- Time stands still
- Often inner thoughts and emotions of
character
- monologue in poetic stanza form
- Features repetition of text & music
    - usually in patterned form

### Examples of arias 
Monteverdi, L’Orfeo (1607), “Vi Ricorda”:
- Orpheus expressing his happiness thanks to his bride, Eurydice
- Strophic: same music with different words (verses)
- Separated by instrumental interludes
- Strong regular rhythm

Handel, Messiah (1742), “Rejoice Greatly”
- Da capo aria (A B A’ form):
    - an opening section, a contrasting section, return of the opening music & words but more ornamented
    - Strong meter (notice the strong meter in 3s here (12/8) here compared to most versions!)

Mozart, Don Giovanni (1787), “Batti, Batti” (Zerlina)
- Zerlina tries to persuade her fiancé Masetto to forgive her
- Flowing cello accompaniment
- Zerlina switches to a meter in 3s at the end (lilting dance rhythm)

## Recitative 
Recitative: reciting style, sung declamation
- Halfway between singing and speaking
- fits natural accents, rhythm, pace & inflections of words
- No strong regular accents
- Syllabic: usually just one note per syllable of text
- Usually used to moves plot forward
- Sometimes consists of dialogue between characters
- “Invented” in 1600:
    - made opera possible
    - More “efficient” style of singing that tells the story more
    quickly than full song

Accompaniment:
- the instrumental accompaniment is usually quite spare and sparse
- Allows the voice to flow naturally like speech rhythms with minimal structure

2 Examples of recitative:

Giulio Cesare, Act II, sc. 1: “Eseguisti…” recitative
- Cleopatra and her friend Nireno conspire to enchant Julius Caesar
- Notice how spare the accompaniment is, allowing the voices to follow the natural speech rhythms in their dialogue.
- The accompaniment style here is called “secco” or “dry”

Monteverdi, Orfeo, Act II:
- Messenger delivers bad news of Eurydice’s death
- Long narrative, very emotionally charged scene
- Delivered in recitative with spare accompaniment & flexible vocal line

Accompaniment: depending on the storyline, the instruments can
accompany the recitative in different ways: 2 styles of accompaniment:
- simple chordal punctuation (secco: “dry”)
    - Consists of just a bass line and instrument filling in
the chords (basso continuo)
- Orchestral: added instrument (accompagnato: “accompanied”)
    - Fuller accompaniment that includes the addition of other instruments of the orchestra


Handel, Messiah: alternates between the 2 styles
- although Messiah is not an opera, it uses operatic elements, like recitative and
aria, and is a great example of alternating styles of accompaniment

Pergolesi, La serva padrona (1733):
- Mix of secco & accompagnato recitative
- Serpina & Uberto in dialogue: secco
- Serpina leaves and Uberto thinks to himself: accompagnato (~1:00)

**Orchestra**: Plays an important dramatic role in telling the story
- It accompanies singers, plays interludes or separate orchestral numbers
- Overture: orchestral introduction to an opera

Handel, Overture to Messiah (1742)
- Typical Baroque form: slow opening section, fast 2<sup>nd</sup> section (both repeated)

Mozart, Overture to Don Giovanni (1787)
- Sonata form with a slow introduction (D minor/D major)
- Microcosm of Don Giovanni’s 2 sides
- Some music returns in the opera

Bizet, Prelude to Carmen (1875)
- Acts like a medley of music to come in the opera, including foreshadowing a “fate”
motive

**Chorus**:
group of singers representing group (vs individual) identity
Sometimes they act like a Greek chorus:
- empathize with main characters
- deliver the moral of the story
- Other times they are the crowd

 Handel, Messiah,
“Glory to God”
(comes right after recitative heard in excerpts 6-9.
