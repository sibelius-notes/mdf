# The Basics of Sociology
This week is a zoomed out look of the sociology.

## Definitions
**What is sociology as a discipline?** Here are 3 'student definitions' (taken from sociology introductory text):
- “the scientific study (observation and explanation) of human
social behaviour”
- “the systematic study of society and of human social
organization”
- “the study of the relationship between individual behaviour and
social group membership”

What are the issues with these definitions? Consider the following:

Is sociology a science? Only the first one mentions "scientific study".
Then different methods and approaches are involved.

Also consider the *significance of observation*. These three definitions mention directly or indirectly the observation, but they don't mention the details of the observation, like the parameters and so on.

Finally, we should note that there are multiple 'right' answers. There's no linear way when study sociology. We will face lots of choices.
Sociology is "messy" discipline as it has a lot of different layers and connections and ideas and no linear way to study sociology.
Besides this, note the role of politics, how sociology works in the real world.

## Purposes
**What is the purpose of sociology?**

If we can't agree on the definitions, at least we can agree on the purpose. In general, the purpose is first to **describe** things like events (e.g., convention), groups (e.g., groups of educators), processes (e.g., process of learning a new language), relations.
Do we describe the things that we are observing from the point of view of the observer or observed? Do we want to take a step back to observe an event and describe how we say it from outside? Or do we want to talk to people about how they experience that
particular thing and describe it from
their perspective?

Beyond description, we can **generalize**: look for patterns when it comes to relations. We draw from particular cases to society in general because we are developing a study where we can't study everybody, do everything.

The third purpose is to explain the descriptions and the
generalizations that we're making from
the observations we make in society. In other words, we **use and apply** some of the findings.
Then we have a question: are we producing knowledge for itself or make the world a better place (politics)? For example, we could do a study on how do partners
in a marriage
deal with domestic violence incidents in
their home or possibly come up with laws or policies to punish domestic violence abusers.
If we choose the latter, namely make the world a better place, then whose definition of better?

## Sociology as a career
To become an expert as a sociologist, we need to do B.A., M.A., PhD.

There are a couple of different elements. One is **substantive areas**. One substantive area is technology, which is like investigating smartphones. The instructor has done some researches on smartphones and how people use them in their daily lives. Other substantive areas include deviance, race, education, and literally everything.

Beyond substantive areas, there's also **methodological** concerns. For method, we are collecting data by asking people questions to gather information we need. There's usually a split between *qualitative* methods and *quantitative* methods.  Qualitative methods comes down to asking people questions and getting at
their words and understanding the
meanings they make about their
experiences in society. Quantitative methods deals with numbers and statistics.

The third part is **theory**. There are many different theoretical 'umbrellas' and 'branches'.

Now back to sociology as a career. Two big things we will have a chance to choose from are *research* or *teaching*, which is much like pure mathematics, having barely no application in industry. The third option for sociologist is industry, which means not in academia, like companies, corporations, industry. These relies on data about people to function. For example, we can think of something like marketing. Big companies need to think about how to improve their products, make commercials so that they can have more people buy their products. These decisions usually are involving sociologists who can collect data and understand people's behavior.

## Levels of Sociological Analysis
Generally speaking, we separate between two major levels of sociological
analysis: **microsociology** and **macrosociology**.

Microsociology is usually an individual or a small group. Let's consider an example for individual: someone converting to a new religion. An example for small group would be like biker gangs in Southern Ontario. Here we are restricting within specific locale Southern Ontario and a specific kind of group.

On the opposite end of the spectrum is macrosociology, which refers to larger, higher, bigger levels of analysis. The unit of analysis could be *whole society* (e.g., Canada). Or it could be whole *types of society*, for which an example could be capitalist societies. When we look at the US and Canada and any other country, then we know we are following a capitalist economic model. Another type of macro level study is looking at *entire institutions*, often longitudinal. For example, family over the course of western history. We have to navigate an entire institution over time.

We also have "mesosociology", which is often between micro and macro. For example, one institution or one small group of institutions (e.g.,
a medical school or a big corporation). Some researcher questions could be like how do Canadian medical schools change their admissions criteria
every year.

Here are some types of question that sociologists ask:

| Research Question | Micro OR Macro SOCIOLOGY?     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| How has post-secondary education evolved in Ontario over the last 50 years? | MACRO |
| How do individuals learn a new language? | MICRO |
| What is the experience of becoming a pharmacist like? | MICRO |
| How have Canadian seniors been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic? | MACRO |

## The Nature of Sociology
The nature of sociology is all sociologies would agree upon.

The first nature is that sociology is **doubly perspectival**. There are two layers of perspective. First layer is that sociology is one social science among many that examine human social behavior, and there's no concrete boundary between
the disciplines. The second  perspective is that once we are within  sociology,
there are lots of different theories or
perspectives approaches and methods to
doing it as well, no one right
approach, method, or kind of sociology.

The second nature is that sociology is **not just divided**, but it's
**conflict-ridden**, in terms of an intellectual and
political perspective. No one will judge you if your favorite color is green. But in sociology, when you say you are a marxist, then it means something. It's not just an arbitrary division.

The third nature is the focus on **'social' elements**. Clearly it is opposed to biological, individual, religious or common sense elements. For example, when studying love, we are not looking for a biological explanation of how people
fall in love and look at the chemicals
in their brain. Neither will we look for individual explanations well that person's a nice
person, or religious explanations, or common sense. We are looking for social explanations of
why you fell in love.
For example, what was your family's background in history? Do you guys have a shared culture or religion? Similar socioeconomic
status or similar educational
backgrounds?

The fourth nature is that sociology is **synthetic**, which means it sometimes uses theory, methods, and data from other disciplines. Synthetic here means to bring things together to synthesize.

The last nature is that sociology is **not purely philosophical or speculative**. We collect data by
observing, sending out
a survey, interviewing somebody. We don't just make up the
answer in our mind.

# Developing a Sociological Imagination
## Definition
Social imagination is basically covered in every introductory sociology course because it is the foundational ability to become a sociologist. Let's first define this term.

This term was introduced by a sociologist, C. Wright Mills, in 1959. According to a quote from him, he defines the sociological imagination as
>  "the vivid awareness of the relationship
between experience and the wider society"

In other words, it is between personal experience and the wider society. We already know there are connections on a surface level. However, we might not know how we do it, how we engage it, how to activate it, how to use it, how to apply it, what contexts it can be applied in. These are the points in this module.

The whole point of the sociological imagination is to **bridge society and the individual**. Alternatively, we can use the terms **‘structure’ vs. ‘agency’**. These are also  fundamental kind of sociological terms
concepts
ideas in our toolkit that help us to
do our researches. As we study sociology, we would prefer using the terms "structure vs. agency". Why? Society demarcates everything whereas individual refers to something inside of us like ourselves not anything outside of us. However, structure is the structure according to which society is formed, how it functions, what institutions are there, what forms the society takes.
Now consider individual vs. agency. Here in sociological discipline, agency is choice, individual ability to choose a path.

Sociological imagination is our ability to recognize individual behaviors and beliefs as
having a connection to wider societal
patterns. This should be clear now that we have drawn the distinction with structure and agency.

Sociological imagination also requires the ability to **see personal troubles as public issues**.  When we're especially in a
society like ours that's very
individualistic, we're told from a
young age
we can do whatever you want if we go
to school; we work hard and then we'll
achieve whatever we can. Because of that individualist mentality, we might have a personal explanation for a personal trouble. When we have activated our sociological imagination, we will start to see a connection between personal troubles
and public issues or society issues, or the way the structure
affects our agency. For example, it's not that I am not working hard enough to make enough money, it's the way the society is structured that's making it impossible for me to make money without having five jobs. Caveat here: this does not mean all personal troubles are a result of public issues. Sometimes a person's individual decisions can be the source of their personal
troubles. Part of sociological
imagination is at least being
able to
zoom out enough and  step out
from our circumstances enough,
to at least contemplate that there might
be a connection
between personal troubles and public
issues.

## How to Develop Your Sociological Imagination

A direct quote from Mills:
> “Neither the life of an individual nor the history of a society can be
understood without understanding both.”

This means the individual who has agency and the
society that has structure,
they are not separate entities even
though they feel that way. This also means there are some linked elements, factors, processes between these two. For example, to understand how the society evolved this way, we need to understand people's experiences, individual history and agency.

Moreover, we can see the **‘unusual’ in the ‘usual’**. We somehow take life for granted. Our goal is not to say this is what society is. Instead,
our goal is to look at it like a stranger, looking for the unusual. For example, why do I wear the clothes I wear? Why do I have the friends I have? All these questions challenge the usual.

We must **‘think yourself away’** from the ordinariness of our everyday experience
to ask and answer sociological questions in an imaginative way. This is Mills' words. He means to take ourselves out of what have been taken for granted and step back and question our everyday experiences.

We can also consider both **macro and micro** factors at play. Take using smartphones as an example, micro elements might be basic level questions like why do I call these people? Macro level factors could be why does someone in society want to get latest iPhone?

We can also consider links between: *individuals and society*; *individuals and history*;
*public and private*; etc. These are a set of dichotomies (二分法). This is a an exercise in our
ability to kind of demarcate
what you experience in our own life. Seeing these connections is where our sociological imagination will start to develop.
