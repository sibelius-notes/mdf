# Linux
## Shell, File System, I/O...
A **shell** is a program that runs in your computer and provides a user interface, which allows you (the user) to communicate with the operating system.

In most Linux distributions, a program called [bash](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/bash1.html) acts as the shell. This name stands for *Bourne Again Shell*, which is an enhanced version of Unix's original shell program, `sh`.

- Standard Input (or `stdin` for short): is a device from where the shell is reading text input.
- Standard Output (or `stdout` for short): is a device to where the shell is writing text output.
- Standard Error (or `stderr` for short): similar to the `stdout`, it is a device where the shell is writing text output. The difference is that the shell and the programs we run usually write normal output to `stdout` and error messages to `stderr`.

As you probably know, the files on our computers are organized into **directories** (also known as **folders**). This organization is implemented by the file system. A **path** is the general name of a file or directory in a textual format.

The path denoted by only `/` is the **root**, i.e., the starting point of the file system. Therefore, all paths are somehow relative to the root directory. Therefore, any path that begins with `/` is an **absolute path** because it clearly identifies where the file or directory is in the file system.

Any path that does not begin with a `/` is a **relative path**. A relative path is always relative to the current directory (or **working directory**).

A dot (`.`) identifies the current directory. Two dots (`..`) identifies the parent of the current directory.

There is a global system variable named `$PATH` that specifies where the shell should find executable files. The contents of the `$PATH` variable are a list of pathnames separated by the colon character (`:`). For example:

```shell
$ echo $PATH
/home/gustavo/bin:/usr/lobal/bin:/usr/bin
```

The command `ls` can be used to list the files (and directories) in the current directory (or any directory if you pass a path as a parameter).

```shell
$ ls -l
-rw-r----- 1 j2smith cs246 25 May 4 15:27 abc.txt
type/perms   owner   group size  modified name
```

Each file or directory has a set of three types of permissions: user, group, and other:

- user permissions: apply to the file's owner user
- group permissions: apply to members of the file's group (other than the owner)
- other permissions: apply to everyone else

Each one of these types may contain three specific permissions: Read, Write, and eXecute.

`Scripts` are text files that contain commands in a specific programming language.

`Programs` are files that contain commands in binary format.

Using `cat` to simply read from the keyboard and output to the monitor does not seem very useful. However, you can use the shell to **redirect** `cat`'s standard input and output devices to read from or write to files.
- Use the character `<` to redirect the standard input.
- Redirect the standard output using the character `>`.
- Redirect the standard error device with `2>`.

You can also pass arguments to a program or script by writing each argument separated by a space after the command name. These are called **command-line arguments**.

If you want to pass a single argument that contains spaces within it, you need to quote the argument with double (`"`) or single (`'`) quotes. The difference is that single quotes will not interpolate anything (e.g., variables), whereas double quotes will.

```shell
$ echo "My shell is $0"
My shell is -bash
$ echo 'My shell is $0'
My shell is $0
```

**Pipes** allow us to use the output of one program as the input of another by connecting the second program's `stdin` to the first program's `stdout`.

## Globbing Patterns
The shell can automatically expand a few wildcard patterns to match all the files that satisfy the pattern. This is known as **globbing**.

| Operator      | Meaning     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| * | matches zero or more characters |
| ?	| matches one character |
| [abc] | matches exactly one of the characters in the brackets |
| [!abc] | matches any character except the ones in the brackets |
| [a-z]	| matches any character in the given range |
| {pat1,pat2} | matches either pat1 or pat2 (note no spaces) |

## Regular Expressions
Now we have the ability to pipe the output of one program into another program. But, what should we do with it? One of the most common things to do with pipes is process data, and one of the most common ways of processing data is **pattern matching**.

The patterns that `egrep` accepts are called **regular expressions**, and they're more powerful than the globbing patterns we've seen before. A regular expression is a pattern formed by combining smaller patterns.

Now it's your time to check all patterns supported by `egrep`. Do a search. I'll not include them here...

## Script
```shell
#!/bin/bash
date
whoami
pwd
```
The very first line of the file isn't required, but it's a good idea! It's called a **shebang** line (less commonly known as "shabang" or "sh-bang") because it starts with the musical sharp symbol ('#') followed by an exclamation point ('!'), which some people call "bang". This line tells the executing shell which shell language the script is written in, since it could be executed in different environments with a different default shell.

bash also has a simple programming language syntax available. This lets you write more complicated scripts.

```shell
#!/bin/bash -x
```
The `-x` option tells bash to print every command and its arguments as it executes.

A bash variable:
```shell
x=1
echo $x
```

Special variables:
- `$0`:  the shell-script name
- `$1`, `$2`: each command-line argument, based upon its position
- `$#`: the total number of command-line arguments
- `$?`: the exit/return value of the most-recently executed command; used to tell us whether it succeeded or failed. 0 means success, while not-0 means failure

Now it's your time to do a search: `if` in bash.

A condition is generally specified within a pair of square brackets, "[ ]". Note that bash is very picky about the spacing in that there must be a blank space between the opening square bracket and the condition being tested, as well as a blank space between the condition and the closing square bracket.

Now it's your time to do a search: function in bash, loop in bash.

# Software Testing
**Software testing** is an investigation conducted to verify if the software works as intended, identify existing errors, and possibly assess the quality of the software.

## Approaches
In **human testing**, a person manually verifies if the software is working as intended and tries to identify existing errors (bugs).

In **automated testing**, test suites are implemented that automatically test the software and compare the results with the expected ones. In general, **test suites** should contain a list of input sets and matching expected outputs, covering different situations according to the requirement specifications.

**Testing** is the process that identifies the errors but does not solve them. **Debugging**, on the other hand, is the process that identifies the causes of known errors to solve them.

## Types of Software Tests
**Unit tests** are conducted at the lowest level, testing only one specific module/unit of the software.

**Integration tests** are conducted a level above the unit tests and aim to verify if the different modules/units of the software work correctly together.

**Functional tests** focus on the business requirements of the application.

**Acceptance tests** are usually part of a formal process in which the client must verify that the produced software meets all the requirements, so it can be accepted.

Sometimes, acceptance tests may be detailed into phases such as **alpha testing** (done at the end of the development, by a subset of users, but in the controlled environment of the developer) and **beta testing** (done at the end of the development after the alpha tests, by a subset of real users, in the user's environment).

**Regression tests** are conducted after any modification in the software, to ensure that it continues working as intended, i.e., that the modification did not introduce new errors.

**Performance tests** are designed to verify if the run-time performance of the system will be adequate.

## White/Black Box Tests
In **white-box tests**, tests are created with knowledge of the internal structure of a program.

In **black-box tests**, tests are created based only on the requirement specifications, without any knowledge of the internal structure of the program (i.e., without access to the source code).

**Grey-box testing** is just a mix of the two approaches above.

# Basic C++
## Basics
The compiler takes a high-level programming language file (or files), and produces machine-readable instructions by first preprocessing (we will explain what preprocessing is later), then compiling (transforming C++ code into Assembler code), assembling (transforming Assembler code into machine code), and linking (combining several pieces of machine code—called object files—into a single executable file).

Options passed into the compiler's cmd-line:
| Option | Meaning     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| -std=c++14 | standard... |
| -g |	Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format. The GNU debugger, gdb, can work with this debugging information.  |
| -c |	Produce an object file (ends in .o) that consists of assembler output. |
| -Wall |	This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning).  |
| -Wextra |	This enables some extra warnings that aren't enabled by -Wall.  |
| -Wpedantic |	This ensures that your code follows the strict ISO C++ standard, with no forbidden extensions.  |
| -D |	Lets us define a macro name as a command-line argument to the compiler. |


There are three global variables in the standard (`std`) **namespace** that define the stream objects used for basic input and output. `cin, cout, cerr`.

Now do some search: `cin.eof()`, `cin.ignore()`, `cin.clear()`.

File I/O

```c++
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream infile{ "input.txt" };
    std::ofstream outfile{ "output.txt" };
    int i;
    while ( true ) {
        infile >> i;
        if ( infile.fail() ) break;
        outfile << i << std::endl;
    }
}
```
Further documentation: [c++.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/)

Now do some search: format the output using `setw`, `setprecision`. [cppref](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip)

## Strings
```c++
#include <string>
...
std::string s = "hey";
std::string name{ "Sibelius" };
```

[cpp.com on strings](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/)

There is an unusual type in C++ called [`stringstream`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/stringstream/), available through the sstream library. It is a hybrid of both the `std::string class`, and the I/O stream classes. It lets you read/write to/from strings using stream operators. (While you can use the `stringstream` for either input or output, we recommend that you use the type explicitly defined for input, [`istringstream`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/istringstream/), or output, [`ostringstream`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/ostringstream/), as appropriate.)


Command-line arguments
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  for (int argi = 0; argi < argc; argi++) {
    std::cout << argv[argi] << std::endl;
  }
}
```

## Functions

You should already be familiar with the concept of separating a function into its `declaration` (signature), and its `definition` (implementation).

Where C++ is different from C is that it allows a function to be **overloaded**.
In other words, I can have more than one function with the exact same function name so long as the number of arguments and/or their types are different. Example from [cpp.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/functions2/):

```c++
// overloading functions
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int operate (int a, int b) {
  return (a*b);
}

double operate (double a, double b) {
  return (a/b);
}

int main () {
  int x=5,y=2;
  double n=5.0,m=2.0;
  cout << operate (x,y) << '\n';
  cout << operate (n,m) << '\n';
  return 0;
}
```

Note that the decision as to which function is to be called must be made at compile-time.


C++ provides a mechanism  called **default parameters**. [cppref](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/default_arguments)

## Structures
[cpp.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/structures/)

C++ no longer uses `NULL`; rather you should be using `nullptr` instead. There's a nice discussion of the reason why at [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/nullptr).

A value is `const` means that it must be initialized when it is defined since it cannot be changed later!

## References
We first need to introduce two terms that are going to help explain the concept, that of **rvalues** and **lvalues**. Scott Meyers, on page 2 of "Effective Modern C++", gives a simple explanation that works well. If you can take the address of an expression, it is an **lvalue**; otherwise, it's an **rvalue**.

So, what is a **reference**? A reference is an lvalue that acts like a constant pointer but the compiler automatically dereferences it. Since it's a constant, it must be initialized when it is defined.

[isocpp](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/references)

## Dynamic memory allocation
The C++ standard uses the terms [automatic](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration) versus dynamic storage.

C++:
- Uses keywords [new](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/dynamic/) and `delete`.
- Type safe i.e. allocates space of the appropriate size and returns a pointer of the appropriate type.

## Returning information
There are three ways in which we can return information from a function in C++:

1. return by value
2. return by pointer
3. return by reference

## Operator overloading
```c++
Vec operator+( const Vec & v1, const Vec & v2 ) {
   Vec v{ v1.x + v2.x, v1.y + v2.y };
   return v;
}
```

## The Preprocessor
Both C and C++ use a tool called the **C preprocessor**, which is tasked with handling **preprocessor directives** like `#include`.
