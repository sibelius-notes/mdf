# Lec 2 - Sept 13
Bill Thompson considers three "abiding controversies" in the psychology of music.

## Music and Psych
There are 6 broad areas of intersection between music and psychology:
1. Performance. Music is performance art, social dynamic.
    - anxiety/"stage fright": related to sports psychology, peak performance, visualization, stress management, etc.
    - development psychology: how do we acquire music skills. Most responses to music are learned. This is also related to music education/talent.
2. Perception/Cognition/Memory. People have different perception towards a certain phenomenon: different discrimination for pitch, high/low, or big/small.
3. Music and language. Music is emotion rather than concepts. Unlike language, requiring two users understanding the same language, there's a huge gap between producing and listening to music.
4. Intersection with Social Psychology: music is main prereq for certain culture. Music serves as a marker for social grouping.
5. Music and emotion. In 20th century, composers tried to take emotion out of the music, then music is all about forms and so on.
6. The "Problem of Creativity". Where does music ideas come from? How are they generated?

## Science
What is sound? acoustical realities. Acoustics now a subfield of fluid dynamics. Musical sound is also pressure wave, but sth unique: tone, a sound that is dominated by a particular frequency. Note that pure tones do not exist in nature.
