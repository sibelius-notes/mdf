# Introduction

## Computer vs human vision

What is (computer) vision?
First let's discuss human vision that's closely related.
Objects bombarded by light (image) -> sensors in the eye
-> brain interpret image -> interpretations.

Then what's computer vision? Sensor is not an eye. They are spread across sensing elements on the image plane inside the camera.  Then the sensor responses are analyzed by computer vision algorithms.

## Vision vs Graphics
Computer graphics is almost dual of computer vision.
For computer graphics, we start with computer models.
Computer vision starts with images, and tries to infer models.
There's a huge intersection between these two areas: modeling.

Moreover, computer vision is a highly interdisciplinary area. Images
are obtained in different sciences: biology, physics and so on. Computer vision is associated with computer science of course. Also, there are some optimization, numerical questions.

The goal of computer vision
is to bridge the gap between pixels and "meaning". The computer actual sees 2d table of numbers/pixels.

Applications:
- optical character recognition
- Object Detection and tracking
- Segmentation (pixel accurate labeling)
- User-assisted Segmentation (photo/video editing)
- Activity recognition
- and so on.

# Image Modalities
## Camera obscura
Consider a model consisting a source light, and it arrives at the surface of the film. This system has a major flaw. The right dot and yellow dot reach not only one point, but also other points on the film. In the end, this film will not register an interesting image. There will be no variation of information across the surface of the film, and it will be overexposed.

Consider a better idea which requires only one additional element. There is a barrier in the middle, which stops most of the light from the object except light passing the hole. Then the barrier blocks off most of the rays, reduces blurring.
